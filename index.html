   <hr> <b>  Thomas Flowers Greatest Invention </b> 
    <p id="greatestinvention" class="para1" > Thomas Flowers has done many cool things in his time, but his most significant creation, was the Colossus. Thomas Flowers was a British engineer, who sadly passed away, October 28th, 1998. Thomas's best invention was the Colossus, which was the first large scale, programmable computer ever invented at the time. The reason this invention was significant at the time of its release, was because it was used to decrypt, around 63 million characters, in German communications, in hours rather than days! Finally, this machine was used to decrypt events like D-day, saving thousands of lives, and ending the war many months earlier than projected! </p>
