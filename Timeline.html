    <p class="para3"> (1905) - December 22, 3 days before Christmas, Tommy Flowers was born in Londons East End. </p>
  
     <p class="para3"> (1922-1926) - In 1922 he enrolled in london University, and in 1926 he passed the intermediate Exam in Engineering, and later on in 1926 he showed he had the foundation for future success, then later on he recived the his degree. </p> 
 
    <p class="para3" > (1926-1930) - In 1926, he recived his first job, at a General Post office, also known as a GPO, where he then later on in 1930, moved to Dollis Hill, on the northern west side of London. </p>

    <p class="para3" > (1939) - In 1939 he kept telling himself, and it was almost like he knew that an all electronic system were possible and , which would prove crucial for his computer design, of the Colossuss in World War II </p>

    <p class="para3" > (1944) - Flowers used a completly different method at the time, while constructing the Colosuss, but none the less he persued it, even though others didnt think it would work as well, and it turns out, January 1st his system worked 5 times faster, than its rival machine at the time. </p>

    <p class="para3" > (1944) - June tst, 1944 the Colosuss Mark II was designed, this second version of the Colosuss, was the one resposible of translating code, regardings the d-day attack </p> 

    <p class ="para3" > (1959-1960) The last time The Colosusses were used to possibly make ground breaking code, was in 1959-1960, which was during the Cold War before they were finally decomissioned </p> 

    <p class="para3"> (1970) - In 1970, Tommy finally got his recognition for his invention, where he also got paid 1000 Euros, which was not enough money to cover his invesment/invention of the Colosuss, since he paid for both of the machines manly out of pocket. </p>
